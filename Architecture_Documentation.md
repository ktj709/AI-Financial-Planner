1. ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The AI Financial Planner is a modular, multi-agent system that transforms a basic banking backend into a proactive, intelligent financial assistant.
It analyzes user spending, plans savings for large purchases, and generates optimized travel budgets â€” all through a natural language or interactive web interface.

The system supports two interfaces:

Command-Line Interface (CLI) â€” for quick text-based interactions.

Streamlit Web App â€” for an interactive, dashboard-like experience.

Both interfaces communicate with the same backend multi-agent architecture.
